Rolls attack or defense dice for Arcadia Quest board game, automatically 
applying rerolls. Odds button simulates 10,000 rolls, showing the average and
max result for the number of dice selected.

  Hits add dice:     This is for the Inferno Widowmaker or other items 
                     which add a die for every hit (not just crits).

  Reroll until crit: Normal behavior will stop using rerolls if every
                     miss has been rerolled. Enable this to use a reroll
                     on a hit until at least one crit comes up.
